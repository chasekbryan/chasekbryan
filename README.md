Welcome to my personal website repository. This site is hosted through GitHub Pages at [https://chasekbryan.github.io](https://chasekbryan.github.io), and serves as both a live project space and a representation of my progress and goals in computer science.

## About Me

My name is Chase Bryan, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at **Colorado Technical University**. As a dedicated and passionate student, I devote the majority of my time to advancing my understanding of core computer science principles, software engineering practices, and programming languages.

### Academic and Technical Focus

I am actively studying and practicing the following:

- **Web Development**: Frontend and backend development using modern tools and frameworks.
- **Python Programming**: Writing efficient, readable, and maintainable Python code for a variety of applications.
- **Computer Science Fundamentals**: Including algorithms, data structures, system design, operating systems, and networking.

## Career Aspirations

My ultimate goal is to become a highly skilled and respected software engineer, with a level of mastery and influence comparable to **Donald Knuth**, whose work in algorithm analysis and literate programming has deeply inspired me.

I aim to:
- Contribute meaningfully to the field of computer science.
- Build real-world software that is both practical and intellectually rigorous.
- Constantly improve through continuous learning, hands-on projects, and professional growth.

## Work Ethic

I am a **hard worker** and an **independent learner**, often dedicating long hours to building projects, reading documentation, and experimenting with new technologies. I believe that the pursuit of excellence in programming requires discipline, curiosity, and perseverance â€” values I strive to uphold every day.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves the following purposes:

- Host my personal website using GitHub Pages
- Document and share my ongoing development projects and skills
- Act as a digital resume and portfolio space for employers and collaborators
